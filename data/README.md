Data is given as just raw, integerized / anonymized, economic block values.
These are regular block models.
Blocks are in order from the leftmost (smallest x), frontmost (smallest y), lowest (smallest z), to the rightmost (largest x), backmost (largest y), highest (largest z).
x cycles fastest, then y, then z.
